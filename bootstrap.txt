Bootstrap
----------
Bootstrap is a powerful front-end framework that simplifies the process of building
responsive and visually appealing websites and web applications. By utilizing its
comprehensive suite of pre-built components and CSS classes, developers can create
stunning interfaces with minimal effort. 

Syntax and Containers:
-----------------------
Bootstrap utilizes intuitive syntax and provides container classes to structure the
layout of web pages effectively. Containers ensure consistent padding and margins across
different screen sizes, maintaining a clean and organized appearance.
       .container, which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint
       .container-{breakpoint}, which is width: 100% until the specified breakpoint
       .container-fluid, which is width: 100% at all breakpoints

Button:
---------
Bootstrap offers a variety of button styles and sizes, making it easy to create visually
engaging call-to-action buttons for various purposes

.btn	Adds basic styling to any button	
.btn-default	Indicates a default/standard button	
.btn-primary	Provides extra visual weight and identifies the primary action in a set of buttons	
.btn-success	Indicates a successful or positive action	
.btn-info	Contextual button for informational alert messages	
.btn-warning	Indicates caution should be taken with this action
.btn-danger	Indicates a dangerous or potentially negative action	
.btn-link	Makes a button look like a link (will still have button behavior)
.btn-outline-* ones to remove all background images and colors on any button.
.btn-lg or .btn-sm for additional sizes.

Grid System:
------------
The responsive grid system in Bootstrap allows developers to create flexible layouts by
dividing the page into 12 columns, facilitating seamless adaptation to different screen sizes
and devices.
*xs (for phones - screens less than 768px wide)
*sm (for tablets - screens equal to or greater than 768px wide)
*md (for small laptops - screens equal to or greater than 992px wide)
*lg (for laptops and desktops - screens equal to or greater than 1200px wide)

Table:
--------
Bootstrap provides CSS classes to style tables, making them more readable and visually appealing
with features such as striped rows, hover effects, and responsive behavior.

.table class adds basic styling to a table
.table-striped class adds zebra-stripes to a table
.table-bordered class adds borders on all sides of the table and cells
.table-hover class adds a hover effect (grey background color) on table rows

Form:
------
With Bootstrap's form components, developers can design user-friendly input fields, checkboxes,
radio buttons, and other form elements, ensuring a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing form layout.

Alert:
-------
Bootstrap's alert component enables developers to display important messages and notifications to
users in a visually striking and attention-grabbing manner.

Badge and Label:
-----------------
Badges and labels are useful for highlighting important information or indicating status. Bootstrap
offers customizable badges and labels to suit various design needs.
*badge class within <span> elements to create badges
*label class,  followed by one of the six contextual classes .label-default, .label-primary, .label-success, .label-info, 
  label-warning or .label-danger

Pagination:
---------------------------
Pagination is a crucial component in web development, particularly when dealing with large datasets or content
spread across multiple pages. Bootstrap offers a convenient way to implement pagination with its built-in components

Pager:
--------
The pagination component in Bootstrap is used for creating navigation between content across multiple pages. 
It typically consists of previous and next buttons to navigate between pages of content.

Image:
--------
Bootstrap offers utility classes for styling images, including responsive images and image thumbnails,
ensuring optimal display on all devices.
.img-rounded class adds rounded corners to an image
.img-circle class shapes the image to a circle 
.img-thumbnail class shapes the image to a thumbnail
The .thumbnail class can be used to display an image gallery
The .caption class adds proper padding and a dark grey color to text inside thumbnails.

Carousel:
-------------
The Bootstrap carousel component allows developers to create dynamic slideshows with images, text, or any other
content, enhancing the visual appeal of web pages.

Progress Bar:
------------------
Progress bars provide visual feedback on the completion status of tasks or processes. Bootstrap's progress
bar component can be customized to match the design aesthetic of the website.
.progress class to a <div> element
